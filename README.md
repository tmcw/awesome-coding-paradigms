### Language-specific approaches

* **html & css** [emmet](https://emmet.io/) _you can type CSS-like expressions that can be dynamically parsed, and produce output depending on what you type in the abbreviation_
* **lisp** [parinfer](https://shaunlebron.github.io/parinfer/) _simplifies the way we write Lisp by auto-adjusting parens when indentation changes and vice versa._
* **haskell** [structured-haskell-mode](https://github.com/chrisdone/structured-haskell-mode) _provides structured editing operations based on the syntax of Haskell_

### Alternative lineage editors

The vast majority of editors inherit for Emacs, with _chords_ - multiple keys held down, like cmd+s - for most functions. A minority are
based on the vim concepts, like neovim and vim emulation modes. And then an even smaller minority are their own style.

* [acme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acme_(text_editor)) _mouse-centric, uses mouse chording and lets you execute commands by clicking on text_
  * see a [demo of Russ Cox demoing acme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dP1xVpMPn8M)

### Visual programming environments

* [DRAKON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DRAKON) _an algorithmic visual programming language developed within the Buran space project following ergonomic design principles_
* [scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/)
  * **javascript / hardware** [micro:bit](https://pxt.microbit.org/)
  * **scheme** [snap!](http://snap.berkeley.edu/)
* [frame-based editing](https://www.greenfoot.org/frames/) _in frame-based editing, each statement or structure in your program is one cohesive, indivisible element: a frame_
* [Interlisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interlisp)
* [Lamdu](http://www.lamdu.org/) _a next-generation live programming environment that radically improves the programming experience_
* [chorus](http://www.chorus-home.org/) _the middle ground between spreadsheets and programming_
* [max/msp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_(software)) _a visual programming language for music and multimedia_
  * [supercollider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SuperCollider) _an environment and programming language originally released in 1996 by James McCartney for real-time audio synthesis and algorithmic composition_
